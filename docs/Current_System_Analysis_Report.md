# Current System Analysis Report

## Core Business Logic and Data Flow

The core business logic of the Resume Matcher system involves parsing resumes and job descriptions, extracting key terms and keywords, and comparing them to provide insights and suggestions for improving the resume. The data flow can be summarized as follows:

1. **Input**: Users provide resumes and job descriptions in PDF format.
2. **Parsing**: The system uses Python to parse the input documents and extract relevant information.
3. **Keyword Extraction**: The system extracts keywords and key terms from the parsed documents using machine learning algorithms.
4. **Comparison**: The system compares the extracted keywords from the resume and job description to calculate a similarity score.
5. **Output**: The system provides insights and suggestions to improve the resume based on the comparison results.

## Key System Interactions and Dependencies

The key system interactions and dependencies in the Resume Matcher system include:

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the system by providing input documents and receiving output insights.
2. **Parsing Libraries**: The system relies on libraries such as `PyPDF2` and `spacy` for parsing and natural language processing.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: The system uses machine learning models for keyword extraction and similarity calculation.
4. **Data Storage**: The system stores parsed data and results in JSON format for further processing and analysis.

## Critical Paths and Bottlenecks

The critical paths and bottlenecks in the Resume Matcher system include:

1. **Parsing Performance**: The performance of the parsing process can be a bottleneck, especially for large documents.
2. **Keyword Extraction Accuracy**: The accuracy of the keyword extraction process is critical for providing meaningful insights.
3. **Similarity Calculation Efficiency**: The efficiency of the similarity calculation process can impact the overall performance of the system.

## Current Architecture Patterns in Use

The current architecture patterns in use in the Resume Matcher system include:

1. **Modular Design**: The system is designed in a modular way, with separate modules for parsing, keyword extraction, and similarity calculation.
2. **Pipeline Architecture**: The system follows a pipeline architecture, where data flows through different stages of processing.
3. **Microservices**: The system can be extended to use microservices for different components, allowing for scalability and maintainability.
