# Architectural Design Document

## System Boundaries and Components

The system boundaries and components of the Resume Matcher system are defined as follows:

1. **Frontend**: The frontend component is responsible for providing the user interface for the Resume Matcher system. It is built using React and communicates with the backend via API calls.

2. **Backend**: The backend component is responsible for handling the business logic and data processing of the Resume Matcher system. It is built using FastAPI and provides API endpoints for the frontend to interact with.

3. **Database**: The database component is responsible for storing the data used by the Resume Matcher system. It is designed using a relational database schema and is accessed by the backend component.

4. **External Services**: The system interacts with external services such as machine learning models and third-party APIs for keyword extraction and similarity calculation.

## Data Model and Database Schema

The data model and database schema for the Resume Matcher system are designed as follows:

1. **User Table**: Stores user information such as user ID, name, email, and password.

2. **Resume Table**: Stores resume information such as resume ID, user ID, resume data, and extracted keywords.

3. **Job Description Table**: Stores job description information such as job description ID, user ID, job description data, and extracted keywords.

4. **Similarity Score Table**: Stores similarity scores between resumes and job descriptions, including resume ID, job description ID, and similarity score.

## API Endpoints and Interactions

The API endpoints and their interactions for the Resume Matcher system are defined as follows:

1. **User API**:
   - `POST /users`: Create a new user.
   - `GET /users/{user_id}`: Retrieve user information.
   - `PUT /users/{user_id}`: Update user information.
   - `DELETE /users/{user_id}`: Delete a user.

2. **Resume API**:
   - `POST /resumes`: Upload a new resume.
   - `GET /resumes/{resume_id}`: Retrieve resume information.
   - `PUT /resumes/{resume_id}`: Update resume information.
   - `DELETE /resumes/{resume_id}`: Delete a resume.

3. **Job Description API**:
   - `POST /job_descriptions`: Upload a new job description.
   - `GET /job_descriptions/{job_description_id}`: Retrieve job description information.
   - `PUT /job_descriptions/{job_description_id}`: Update job description information.
   - `DELETE /job_descriptions/{job_description_id}`: Delete a job description.

4. **Similarity Score API**:
   - `POST /similarity_scores`: Calculate similarity score between a resume and a job description.
   - `GET /similarity_scores/{similarity_score_id}`: Retrieve similarity score information.

## Authentication and Authorization Strategy

The authentication and authorization strategy for the Resume Matcher system is defined as follows:

1. **Authentication**: The system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. Users are required to provide their credentials (email and password) to obtain a JWT, which is then used to authenticate subsequent API requests.

2. **Authorization**: The system uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. Different roles (e.g., admin, user) have different levels of access to the system's resources and functionalities.

## Caching and Performance Optimization Strategies

The caching and performance optimization strategies for the Resume Matcher system are defined as follows:

1. **Caching**: The system uses a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) to store frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database. This helps improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the system.

2. **Performance Optimization**: The system employs various performance optimization techniques, such as query optimization, indexing, and load balancing, to ensure efficient resource utilization and minimize response times.
